    <h2>A quick and easy side dish, with only 6 ingredients!</h2>

    <p> These sprouts are healthy, delicious, and especially cozy in the Fall. Everyone raves when I bring these to Thanksgiving dinner or a holiday potluck!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb Brussels sprouts, woody ends removed and halved (or quartered if large)</li>
        <li>2 tbsp coconut oil, melted</li>
        <li>1 tbsp pure maple syrup</li>
        <li>1 tbsp balsamic vinegar</li>
        <li>Â½ tsp fine sea salt</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375F. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper. (You can also roast directly on the pan for extra crispiness!)</li>
        <li>Place Brussels sprouts in a large bowl. Add the rest of the ingredients and toss to coat.</li>
        <li>Spread in an even layer cut-side down on baking sheet. Make sure Brussels sprouts aren't touching to ensure browning. Bake for 25 minutes, stirring halfway through. Serve warm!</li>
    </ul>
