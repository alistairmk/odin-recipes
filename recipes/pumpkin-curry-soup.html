    <h2>A 30 minute vegan soup recipe that warms you up!</h2>

    <p>This bright orange soup is full of spicy Thai flavor. It's so easy and inexpensive to make with canned pumpkin, and it tastes amazing! Adjust the amount of curry paste to your tolerance: I use a very spicy Thai brand, for maximum heat!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 teaspoons coconut oil</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups chopped sweet yellow onion</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons Thai red curry paste</li>
        <li>2-3 cups low-sodium vegetable broth</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons peanut butter</li>
        <li>2 cans pure pumpkin puree</li>
        <li>1/2 tablespoon light brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 can light coconut milk</li>
        <li>For topping: chopped roasted peanuts or pepitas, chopped fresh cilantro, coconut cream or plain nonfat Greek yogurt</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large pot or Dutch oven, melt the coconut oil over medium heat. Add the onion and saut√© for 5 minutes, until translucent. Add the garlic and ginger and cook 1 additional minute, until fragrant. Stir in the Thai curry paste.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl or large measuring cup, whisk together 1/3 cup of the vegetable broth and the almond butter or peanut butter until smooth. Add the mixture to the pot. Add the pumpkin, coconut sugar, cumin, salt, pepper, cayenne, and 1 2/3 cups of the remaining vegetable broth. Stir until well combined.</li>
        <li>With an immersion blender, puree the soup until completely smooth, adding a little of the coconut milk if it is too thick to blend smoothly. Alternatively, you can ladle the soup carefully into a blender or food processor and puree it in small batches. Stir in the remaining coconut milk. If the soup is too thick for your liking, add additional vegetable broth until you reach your desired consistency.</li>
        <li>Taste and add additional salt, black pepper as desired. Serve hot with desired toppings.</li>
    </ol>
