    <h2>Crispy roasted chickpeas make an easy vegan taco filling!</h2>

    <p>Chickpea tacos are full of protein and fiber, and you can make them with taco seasoning packets, or your own spice blend. This is a favorite for parties - put out lots of toppings and let folks choose their own. You can soak and cook dried chickpeas, too, if you aren't as lazy as I am!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 can chickpeas, rinsed</li>
        <li>Taco seasoning</li>
        <li>Hard taco shells or soft taco tortillas</li>
        <li>Toppings of your choice:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Avocado</li>
                <li>Shredded lettuce</li>
                <li>Diced tomato</li>
                <li>Sauteed peppers and onions</li>
                <li>Sour cream</li>
                <li>Salsa</li>
                <li>Cilantro</li>
                <li>Lime juice coleslaw</li>
                <li>... on and on and on!</li>
            </ul>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Season the chickpeas.</strong> Dry the rinsed chickpeas well with paper towels before transferring them to a bowl. Sprinkle taco seasoning over top and stir to coat.</li>
        <li><strong>Roast the chickpeas.</strong> Spread the seasoned chickpeas in an even layer on a baking sheet. Roast in the oven until golden brown and crispy, stirring halfway.</li>
        <li><strong>Prep the taco toppings.</strong> Meanwhile, prep the rest of your vegan taco fillings: pickle the red onion, chop the cilantro, and make the spicy avocado dressing. Warm the tortillas in the oven, microwave, or on the stove.</li>
        <li><strong>Assemble.</strong> To assemble, pile the crispy roasted chickpeas and taco toppings into the warm tortillas. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
